=head1 NAME

send-nntp - Send Usenet articles to remote sites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<send-nntp> [B<-d>] I<sitename>[B<:>[I<port>B<@>]I<hostname>]
[I<sitename>[B<:>[I<port>B<@>]I<hostname>] ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<send-nntp> processes the batch files written by B<innd> to send Usenet
articles to remote NNTP sites.  The sites to be fed are specified by
giving C<sitename:hostname> pairs on the command line.  The I<sitename>
is the label the site has in the F<newsfeeds> file, the I<hostname> is
the real hostname of the remote site, a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
Normally, the I<sitename> and the I<hostname> are the same, and as such don't
have to be specified as C<sitename:hostname> pairs but just as C<sitename>.

B<send-nntp> starts B<innxmit> to send the articles to remote sites.
By default, NNTP port C<119> is used to connect to remote sites.  In case
another port should be used, it has to be prepended to I<hostname> in a
syntax like C<sitename:port@hostname>.

The batch files generated by B<send-nntp> for a given site is named
F<sitename> in the I<pathoutgoing> directory.  To prevent batch file
corruption, shlock(1) is used ensure these files are not processed by two
running instances in parallel.

=head1 NOTES

You should probably not use B<send-nntp>, but B<innfeed>, or if that is not
possible, B<nntpsend>.  The usual flags for a batch file for B<send-nntp>
are C<Tf,Wfm> in F<newsfeeds>.
